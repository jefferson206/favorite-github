# GitHub Repo Tracker

**A simple React application to track your favorite GitHub repositories and view their issues.**

This project allows you to create a list of your favorite GitHub repositories. You can add repos through a search field, and once added, you can view both open and closed issues for each repo. It's a great way to stay updated with repositories you're interested in!

---

## Features

- **Search Repositories**: Quickly find any GitHub repository using a search field.
- **Add Repositories**: Add repositories to your favorites list.
- **View Issues**: For each repo, see all open and closed issues directly in the app.
- **Responsive Design**: The app is responsive and works across different screen sizes.
